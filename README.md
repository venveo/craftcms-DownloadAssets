# Download Assets plugin for Craft CMS

A Craft CMS plugin to download any selection of assets from the control panel.

## Usage
1. Move the `downloadassets` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory.
2. Go to Settings &gt; Plugins from your Craft control panel and enable the `Download Assets` plugin
3. Go to your Dashboard, click the Gear, click "+ New Widget", and choose the type of "Download Local Assets"
4. Hit Save, and return to your dashboard
5. At any point, you can now download all of your assets from any local Source (or all local Sources at once) from the dashboard

## Notes
- Currently you can only download files from Local Sources. However, I'm absolutely open to suggestions that it should allow non-Local sources, if there are good use cases for that.
